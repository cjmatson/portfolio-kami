## Summary

In the 21st century, procrastination is habitual and distractions are common due to social media, the Internet and new-age technology. Work efficiency is a struggle. BlocTime was built to eliminate those hindrances so workers can produce satisfactory content and maintain production during work sessions. While it's significant for workers to stay on task during work sessions, it's also important to reward them with break sessions. BlocTime allows workers to take breaks in between work sessions to rest their mind and body from the labor. During break sessions, it's recommended that workers also recap and review their work before beginning a new work session.

## Explanation

The creation of an application doesn't happen overnight. Construction takes time and effort because factors must be considered when building the application. BlocTime strives to achieve the following objectives in order to establish a simple, yet effective time management application:

- Determine the proper amount of time per work session, make sure it counts down to zero and transition to break
- Determine the proper amount of time per break session and make sure it counts down to zero and transition to work
- Create a sound that signals switch in sessions
- Record the number of completed work sessions to create a longer break session
- Record the tasks and sync them into a database that compiles a task history
- Show completed tasks on the application 

It's important to note that the tasks listed are presented as examples.

## Solution

The first order of business is to decide the duration for the work sessions. The work sessions shouldn't be too short, but also shouldn't be too long. The set time per work session is 25 minutes. It's highly unlikely that a 25-minute work session would fry users' brain or body, but it's also amenable to productivity. After all, the majority of television news programs operate with a 30-minute allotment. 

When a 25-minute work session expires, a 5-minute work session commences. The break permits users to rest and relax, review or preview work, check their social media accounts, smartphone, etc. The break is the users' time. However, a break session's duration should only be a small fraction of a work session's length.

A number is tallied internally every time a work session is completed. When the number of completed work sessions reaches four, the duration of the next break session will be 30 minutes. Four work sessions amounts to 100 minutes. When users work for 100 minutes, it's more than OK to grant them an extended break, just like employees who need a lunch or dinner break after working the first half of their shift. 

After the fourth work session is completed, the number resets to zero. In essence, a 30-minute break session occurs every four completed work sessions. During work and break sessions, users are free to pause and restart their session. They can do so by clicking on the button underneath the timer.

When the timer hits zero, a sound will alert users of a transition from work to break and vice versa. 

On the left side of the time-management application is an input. Users can keep track of their tasks by entering them into the input. The tasks are displayed underneath the heading. The tasks are presented in reverse chronological order, meaning that the oldest task is listed at the bottom.

## Conclusion 

When used appropriately, BlocTime is an effective, useful way to sustain a work-break balance. With that being said, the onus is ultimately on the users. BlocTime is only as good as the users' work ethic.
