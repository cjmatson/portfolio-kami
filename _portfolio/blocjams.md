## Summary

Music is the rhythm that gives life a beat. It is the soundtrack of our lives. Without music, life is awkwardly silent. In the 21st century, the market has steered toward music contained in digital audio files and abandoned compact-discs (CDs). Bloc Jams is a digital music service that allows users to play their favorite music. Users have the ability to be their own personal disc jockey (DJ). In addition to selecting music, users have access to a player bar that offers integral capabilities enhancing the listening experience and a library that collects all of their favorite albums. The application is ad-free and streamable on all platforms.

## Explanation 

Assembling a digital music service application is complex and extensive, but what Bloc Jams focuses on is simplifying operations for the users so they can listen to the music play enjoyably. Less is more, and if the application is too convoluted, then it can ruin users' experience. The keys to the application are the following:

- Establish a music collection that not only stores the library's albums, but also is also accessible anywhere in the application
- Create a player bar that offers seek, play and volume controls
- Show album pages that display the song listings

It's important to note that Bloc Jams albums and songs serve as placeholders for the digital music service application.

## Solution

Any website or application has to feature a home page or landing. Bloc Jams is no different. The landing isn't anything special and doesn't contain significant functionalities, but it is home to a feature that is included in all of the application's pages: the navigation bar. The navigation bar shows the Bloc Jams logo on the left-hand side. A link to the home page is embedded into the logo. On the opposite side of the navigation bar is a link to the collection, which is embedded into the library.

To make the landing aesthetically pleasing, random album covers are displayed underneath the application's selling points.

While the landing is the building block for the application, the collection is the container for music. The music is stored within the albums, and the albums are placed inside the collection page. 

The collection page will show all of the album's pertinent information: the title, the artist and the number of songs. When users hover over the album, an overlay will appear that allows users to begin playing the music. The button to the right of it adds the album to a playlist.

The link to the album page is embedded in the album's title and artist listing underneath the placeholder in the library. In the album page, users will find the song listing. Each of the songs includes a play-pause button and the song's duration.

An important feature that binds the collection and album pages is the player bar. A digital music service application isn't much without a player bar. Bloc Jams' player bar offers basic seek, song and volume controls. Besides a play-pause button, the player bar also features buttons that switch to either the previous or next song. If users want to mute the music, all they have to do is simply click on the volume icon.

## Conclusion

Bloc Jams is a simple, yet effective digital music service application that fulfills the users' desire: music. The music is streamable on all platforms advertisement-free. But, most importantly, the music is in the hands of the users, which is the ultimate purpose of Bloc Jams.
