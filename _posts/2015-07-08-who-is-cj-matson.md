title: Who Is C.J. Matson?
--- 

While my blog is still new and fresh, I think it's important for my readers to learn more about who I am. Everyone is unique and has a story. In this blog post, I will tell my story. 

My name is C.J. Matson. I was born and raised in the North Star State, Minnesota. I lived in Minnesota from 1988 to 2010 and moved back to the Twin Cities in 2014. I moved to Kansas while attending the University of Kansas from 2010 to 2012, and I resided in Arizona from 2012 to 2014. 

Like anyone else, I have hobbies and interests. To live a joyous, prosperous and satisfying life, people should work to live, not live to work. Even though it's critical to work in a profession that you genuinely enjoy, there's more to life than logging hours and collecting paychecks. 

In my spare time, I love to exercise. Weightlifting at the gym is a passion. Pumping iron is my healthy addiction. I can't live life without a gym membership.

But weightlifting isn't the only type of exercise that I practice. Getting outside and enjoying the fresh air is invigorating, which is why I incorporate jogging, walking and hiking into my exercise routine. When I lived in Arizona, I began hiking because I wanted to explore the mountains. Growing up in Minnesota, I was unable to experience mountain life. Among my most memorable hikes in Arizona was my trek up Humphreys Peak in Flagstaff, Arizona, which stands more than 12,000 feet above sea level. It was the most physically demanding experience of my life.

Ever since I was a kid, I have always followed sports closely. Before I changed my career to web development, I was a sports journalist. In 2012, I graduated from the University of Kansas with a bachelors degree in journalism. During my time at KU, I worked at the student newspaper and radio station as a sports journalist. After college graduation, I relocated to Lake Havasu City, Arizona, and worked as both the Sports Editor and as a Copy Editor at the Today's News-Herald. My favorite sports teams are the Kansas Jayhawks, Minnesota Timberwolves, Vikings, Twins and Wild.

Music is the beat that gives life rhythm. I'm a sucker for live music. Among my favorite bands are the Grateful Dead, Dave Matthews Band, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band and Phish. I own a large collection of those four bands' live albums. I never grow tired of listening to them.

Web development is and will always be a part of who I am. With that said, my future in web development excites me. I can't wait to see how my web development career unfolds and to share it with readers.
