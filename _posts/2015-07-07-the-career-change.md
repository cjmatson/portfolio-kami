title: The Career Change
---

When someone reflects on their life, not only do they remember the fond times, but they also remember the trying times. It's hardly by choice. Those trying times are etched into your life, whether you like it or not. But how you choose to remember those trying times is a choice.

My life was at a crossroads in 2014 and early 2015. When I was the Sports Editor of the Today's News-Herald in Lake Havasu City, Arizona, I had five immediate bosses from January to August of 2014. Because of work instability and my living situation, I was simply unhappy with my life. Change was necessary.

After living in Lake Havasu City for two years, I decided to move back to the Twin Cities in September 2014. Moving back to Minnesota gave me a fresh, new start. It recharged my battery. On top of that, I was living close to my family and friends. I was happy again.

But I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life. When I attended college at the University of Kansas, I aspired to be a sports journalist. But because of my turbulent experience working at the Today's News-Herald, I was uncertain about my future in journalism. I was scared. I was scared because I was afraid of starting over and changing my career. I worked industriously in journalism and was ready to seize opportunities in a larger market. 

But the opportunities were scarce. I was unable to find jobs that fit my skillset and expertise. My life was in limbo.

I sought guidance from my mom and sister. My sister suggested that I watch introductory web development and programming videos online through Lynda. The videos were informative and interesting, but most importantly, enjoyable. I enjoyed learning web development. Web development was something that I could envision myself doing for a living. 

Because I wanted a formal education in web development, I searched for web development programs. The idea of returning to school and being in a classroom again didn't enthrall me. My sister shared an article with me about possible web development programs. I encountered Bloc Academy. The idea of working at my own pace online and meeting with a mentor one-on-one intrigued me. I knew Bloc Academy would be my choice for web development education.

I sought advice from one more person: my cousin in-law, who is the Director of Web Development at a company in Phoenix. His advice was invaluable and persuasive. It ultimately convinced me to pursue a career in web development. He recommended specialization in web development. Building websites and applications is a rewarding, enjoyable and satisfying challenge. Because of that, I chose frontend development.

I choose to remember those trying times in Arizona as the beginning of my road to a career change. Life is not a cake walk; there bumps along the way. Just like sports, it's vital to make adjustments in life. I made one that'll benefit me immensely.
