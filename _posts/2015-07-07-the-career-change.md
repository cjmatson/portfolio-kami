title: The Career Change
---

When someone reflects on their life, not only do they remember the fond times, but they also remember the trying times. It's hardly by choice. Those trying times are etched into your life, whether you like it or not. But how you choose to remember those trying times is a choice.

I lived in Lake Havasu City, Arizona for two years working as the sports editor of a daily newspaper. After two years, I decided to move back to the Twin Cities. Moving back to Minnesota gave me a fresh, new start. It recharged my battery. On top of that, I was living close to my family and friends. I was happy.

But I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life. When I attended college at the University of Kansas, I aspired to be a sports journalist. I was uncertain about my future in journalism. I was scared. I was scared because I was afraid of starting over and changing my career.  

I sought guidance from my mom and sister. My sister suggested that I watch introductory web development and programming videos online through Lynda. The videos were informative and interesting, but most importantly, enjoyable. I enjoyed learning web development. Web development was something that I could envision myself doing for a living. 

Because I wanted a formal education in web development, I searched for web development programs. The idea of returning to school and being in a classroom again didn't enthrall me. My sister shared an article with me about possible web development programs. I encountered Bloc Academy. The idea of working at my own pace online and meeting with a mentor one-on-one intrigued me. I knew Bloc Academy would be my choice for web development education.

I sought advice from one more person: my cousin in-law, who is the Director of Web Development at a company in Phoenix. His advice was invaluable and persuasive. It ultimately convinced me to pursue a career in web development. He recommended specialization in web development. Building websites and applications is a rewarding, enjoyable and satisfying challenge. Because of that, I chose frontend development.

Life is not a cake walk; there bumps along the way. Just like sports, it's vital to make adjustments in life. I made one that'll benefit me immensely.
